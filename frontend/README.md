## Project Structure

```
frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.py             # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_frontend.py         # Frontend launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demo.py                 # Demo and testing scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## Configuration

The frontend connects to the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` by default. This can be configured in the `dashboard.py` file:

```python
API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```

## Development

To run in development mode:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py --server.port 8501
```

## Customization

### Styling
The dashboard uses custom CSS for professional styling. You can modify the styles in the `dashboard.py` file.

### API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend through REST API calls. All API interactions are handled in the `make_api_request()` function.

### Adding New Features
1. Add new functions to `dashboard.py`
2. Update the navigation menu
3. Add corresponding backend API endpoints
4. Test the integration

## Dependencies

- Streamlit - Web application framework
- Requests - HTTP client for API calls
- Pandas - Data manipulation
- Plotly - Interactive visualizations
- Python-multipart - File upload support

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
- Ensure the backend server is running on port 8000
- Check firewall settings
- Verify API_BASE_URL configuration

### File Upload Issues
- Check file size limits (10MB default)
- Verify file format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Ensure upload directory permissions

### Performance Issues
- Use smaller file sizes for testing
- Check system resources
- Monitor API response times
